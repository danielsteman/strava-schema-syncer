Marathon Training Plan (3:30 Target – April 12, 2026)
Current Fitness and Goal Pace

A 3:30 marathon requires averaging about 4:59 min/km (8:01 min/mile)
mymottiv.com
. Common benchmarks for this goal are a sub-50 min 10K (≈4:59/km) and a sub-1:42 half marathon
mymottiv.com
. The runner’s current 10K pace (~4:45/km) comfortably meets this, which is a strong base
mymottiv.com
. However, running 15K at 5:15/km (≈1:19 half) is considerably slower than the marathon target pace, indicating the need to build endurance and tempo speed to sustain ~5:00/km for 42K. Training will therefore focus on raising the pace of longer runs and improving overall stamina.

Key Workouts and Mileage Progression

Long Runs (Weekly): One long run per week, gradually increasing distance. These runs should be done much slower than marathon pace – often 30–90 seconds per mile (20–56 sec/km) slower than goal pace

– so you conserve energy while building endurance. Start around 10–12 km and build up toward ~25–30 km in the final month. (Hal Higdon advises long runs at a very comfortable, conversational pace
halhigdon.com
.)

Tempo/Speed Runs: One mid-week workout at faster pace. This could be a continuous tempo run or interval session. For example, include sustained efforts of 4–10 km at near or slightly faster than goal marathon pace (∼3:50–4:20/km)

. These workouts improve your threshold and teach your legs the marathon goal pace under fatigue

.

Easy Runs: The remaining run of the week should be at an easy, recovery pace (comfortable conversation speed) to accumulate mileage and aid recovery

. This run reinforces aerobic base without undue stress.

Rest / Cross-Training: Take at least 2 rest days per week
mymottiv.com
. On some rest days, very light cross-training (swimming, cycling, etc.) can be done to stay active while unloading running stress
halhigdon.com
. In Hal Higdon’s programs, for example, runners often alternate a long run with a recovery day or cross-training (swim/bike/walk) to help muscles recover

.

Weekly Mileage and Progression: Begin around the current base (~25 km in Week 1) and increase gradually (a good rule is ≲10% increase per week)
vimazi.run
. Every 3–4 weeks include a “step-back” week where you cut total mileage by ~20–30% to recover
halhigdon.com
. This pattern helps consolidate gains and prevent overtraining. For example, Hal Higdon’s plans reduce volume every third week in this way
halhigdon.com
. Over 20 weeks the plan builds total weekly volume from ~25 km to about 45 km at its peak (roughly 30 miles), which is moderate compared to many advanced plans (typical 35–55 mi/week
vimazi.run
).

Taper (Final 1–2 Weeks): In the last two weeks, sharply reduce volume (≈50–60%) to be fresh for race day
mymottiv.com
. For instance, the week before the marathon drops the long run significantly and cuts all workouts short, then the race week itself has only a couple of short easy runs before the marathon
mymottiv.com
.

Each week’s three runs will thus consist of one long run, one moderately hard run (tempo/interval), and one easy run. This follows standard marathon plans
mymottiv.com
. Over the plan we steadily lengthen the long run and sprinkle in faster workouts, while keeping ample rest.

20-Week Training Schedule

Below is a week-by-week plan from late November 2025 up to the week of April 12, 2026. Each week lists three workouts (in km) on separate days (with at least one rest day between runs). Long runs increase over time with cutback (“step-back”) weeks roughly every 4th week. The final weeks sharply taper. Entries like “easy run”, “steady run”, and “long run” indicate the effort: long runs are at easy pace, steady/tempo runs include faster segments, and easy runs are very comfortable. For example, by late March the long run reaches ≈25 km, and total weekly volume peaks around 45 km (consistent with building a marathon base
vimazi.run
). The last row (Week of Apr 6–12) shows short runs (6 km, 4 km) and the marathon (42 km) on April 12.

Key: “easy run” = relaxed pace; “steady run” = moderate effort (with some marathon-pace segments); “long run” = long distance at comfortable pace. Step-back weeks are 4, 8, 12, 16 (lower total km) and Week 20 is race week. This progressive schedule follows standard marathon training principles
