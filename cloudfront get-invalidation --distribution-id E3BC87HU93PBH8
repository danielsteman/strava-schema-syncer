[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m--distribution-id [22m(string) [required]
          The distribution's ID.

       [1m--id [22m(string) [required]
          The  identifier  for  the  invalidation  request, for example, [1mIDFD-[0m
          [1mVBD632BHDS5 [22m.

       [1m--cli-input-json [22m| [1m--cli-input-yaml [22m(string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       [1m--generate-cli-skeleton[22m. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with [1m--cli-input-yaml[22m.

       [1m--generate-cli-skeleton [22m(string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value [1minput[22m, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for [1m--cli-input-json[22m. Similarly, if provided [1myaml-input [22mit will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with [1m--cli-input-yaml[22m. If provided
       with the value [1moutput[22m, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not
       stable  between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards com-
       patibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

[1mGLOBAL OPTIONS[0m
       [1m--debug [22m(boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       [1m--endpoint-url [22m(string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       [1m--no-verify-ssl [22m(boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       [1m--no-paginate [22m(boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       [1m--output [22m(string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       +o json

       +o text

       +o table

       +o yaml

       +o yaml-stream

       [1m--query [22m(string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       [1m--profile [22m(string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       [1m--region [22m(string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       [1m--version [22m(string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       [1m--color [22m(string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       +o on

       +o off

       +o auto

       [1m--no-sign-request [22m(boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       [1m--ca-bundle [22m(string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       [1m--cli-read-timeout [22m(int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       [1m--cli-connect-timeout [22m(int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

       [1m--cli-binary-format [22m(string)

       The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is
       base64.  The  base64  format  expects  binary blobs to be provided as a
       base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves  compati-
       bility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed liter-
       ally.  When  providing  contents  from a file that map to a binary blob
       [1mfileb:// [22mwill always be treated as binary and use the file contents di-
       rectly regardless of the [1mcli-binary-format [22msetting. When using  [1mfile://[0m
       the  file  contents  will need to properly formatted for the configured
       [1mcli-binary-format[22m.

       +o base64

       +o raw-in-base64-out

       [1m--no-cli-pager [22m(boolean)

       Disable cli pager for output.

       [1m--cli-auto-prompt [22m(boolean)

       Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

       [1m--no-cli-auto-prompt [22m(boolean)

       Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

       Invalidation -> (structure)
          The  invalidation's information. For more information, see Invalida-
          tion Complex Type <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/lat-
          est/DeveloperGuide/InvalidationDatatype.html>
           .

          Id -> (string) [required]
              The identifier for the invalidation request. For example:  [1mIDFD-[0m
              [1mVBD632BHDS5 [22m.

          Status -> (string) [required]
              The  status  of  the invalidation request. When the invalidation
              batch is finished, the status is [1mCompleted [22m.

          CreateTime -> (timestamp) [required]
              The date and time the invalidation request was first made.

          InvalidationBatch -> (structure) [required]
              The current invalidation information for the batch request.

              Paths -> (structure) [required]
                 A complex type that contains information  about  the  objects
                 that you want to invalidate. For more information, see Speci-
                 fying   the   Objects  to  Invalidate  <https://docs.aws.ama-

                 Quantity -> (integer) [required]
                     The number of invalidation paths specified  for  the  ob-
                     jects that you want to invalidate.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A complex type that contains a list of the paths that you
                     want to invalidate.

                     (string)

              CallerReference -> (string) [required]
                 A value that you specify to uniquely identify an invalidation
                 request.  CloudFront uses the value to prevent you from acci-
                 dentally resubmitting an identical request. Whenever you cre-
                 ate a new invalidation request, you must specify a new  value
                 for [1mCallerReference [22mand change other values in the request as
                 applicable.  One way to ensure that the value of [1mCallerRefer-[0m
                 [1mence  [22mis  unique  is  to  use  a  [1mtimestamp  [22m,  for  example,
                 [1m20120301090000 [22m.

                 If you make a second invalidation request with the same value
                 for  [1mCallerReference  [22m, and if the rest of the request is the
                 same, CloudFront doesn't create a new  invalidation  request.
                 Instead,  CloudFront  returns information about the invalida-
                 tion request  that  you  previously  created  with  the  same
                 [1mCallerReference [22m.

                 If  [1mCallerReference [22mis a value you already sent in a previous
                 invalidation batch request but the content  of  any  [1mPath  [22mis
                 different  from  the  original request, CloudFront returns an
                 [1mInvalidationBatchAlreadyExists [22merror.
